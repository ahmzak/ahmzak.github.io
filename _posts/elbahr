Going to put a [link](#here) here.

A year ago I floated around the idea of a poetry series, so here it is. The main focus of this series will be linguistic, to help build up your Arabic lexicon and get familiar with Arabic poetry. I'll try and discuss themes, symbols and historical references of course but the primary concern will always be the vocabulary. I urge you to listen to the linked recitations of poems first; a big part of the beauty of poetry is to hear it being recited. With that out of the way let's begin.

This poem (ﻗﺼﻴﺪﺓ) was written in the first half of 2012, well after the initial euphoria of the Arab Spring had evaporated, and uncertainty and fear had settled in. It's meaty, saturated with references to Arab history and lore as well as religious imagery. Please take a few minutes to hear it recited at least once before moving on.

# The Poem

<div class="ar rtl"></div>

-:|:-
أحتاجُ دمعَ الأنبياءِ لكي أرى | شيءٌ يطلُ الآنَ منْ هذي الذُرى
'يتشاكسانِ هناكَ 'قالَ'، و'فسرا | النصُّ للعرافِ والتأويلُ لي
ما نمتُ كي أصطادَ رؤيا في الكَرى | ما قلْتُ للنجمِ المعلّقِ: دُلّني
حتى قبضتُ الماءَ حينَ تبخرا | شجرٌ من الحدسِ القَديمِ هززتهُ
ماذا سيجري حينَ طالعَ ما جرى | لا سرّ..فانوسُ النبوءةِ قالَ لي
تفاحتينِ وذنبهُ لن يُغفرا | في الموسمِ الآتي سيأكلُ آدمٌ
الموتُ سوفَ يكونُ فينا أنهُرا | الأرضُ سوفَ تشيخُ قبل أوانِها
مَن يُقنع الطوفان ألا يعبُرا؟ | وسيعبرُ الطوفانُ مِن أوطانِنا
وسيرتقي ذئبُ الجبالِ المِنبرا | ستقولُ ألسنةُ الذبابِ قصيدةً
سيعودُ سيفُ القُرمطيّ ليثأرا | :فوضى..وتنبئُ كلَّ من مرّت بهم
حتى الأمامُ سيستديرُ إلى الورا | وسيسقطُ المعنى على أنقاضنَا
ستزيدُ أشجارُ الضبابِ تجذُرا | في الموسم الآتي ستشتبكُ الرؤى
نظّارتينِ من السرابِ ليُبصرا | وسيُنكِرُ الأعمَى عصاهُ ويرتدي
فالأزدُ لا زالت تخافُ الشّنفرا | سيرى القبيلَةَ وهي تَصلُبُ عبدَها
سيقولُ إنا لاحِقانِ بقيصرا | سيرى المؤذنَ والإمامَ كِلاهُما
حتى دمُ الموتى يُباعُ ويُشترى | في الموسمِ الآتِي مزادٌ مُعلنٌ
الغيمةُ الحُبلى هُنا لن تُمطِرا | ناديتُ يا يعقوب تلكَ نُبوءتي
عندَ الصّباحِ سيحمَدُ القومُ السُّرى | قالَ اتّخِذ هذا الظلام خريطةً
وغداً تُأمّركَ الرياحُ على القُرَى | لا تَبتئِس فالبئرُ يومٌ واحدٌ
قطّعنَ أيديهنّ عنك تَصَبُّرا | اخلع سَوادَكَ..في المدينة نسوةٌ
للخارجينَ الآن من صمتِ الثرَى | قُم..صلّ نافلة الوصولِ تحيّةً
مِنْ ألفِ بابٍ إِنْ أَرادوا خَيْبَرا | واكشِف لِأخوتِكَ الطريقَ ليَدخُلوا
من حكمةِ الوجعِ المُصابِر سُكّرا | ستَجيءُ سبعٌ مُرّةٌ..فلتَخزِنوا
مِن بعدِها التّاريخُ يرجِعُ أخضَرا | سبعٌ عِجافٌ..فاضبِطوا أنفاسَكُم
مُدُّوا خيامَ القلبِ، واشتَعِلوا قِرى | هيَ تلكَ قافلةُ البشيرِ تَلوحُ لي
هطَلَ القَميصُ على العُيون وبَشّرا | أشتمُّ رائحةَ القميصِ..وطالما

#Interpretation

The poem is about the Arab Spring, with the poet predicting years of calamity and chaos ahead, but ends on a hopeful note. He foresees much bloodshed (اﻟﻤﻮﺕ ﺳﻮﻑ ﻳﻜﻮﻥ ﻓﻴﻨﺎ ﺃﻧﻬﺮا); the scum of the earth will have a say (ﺳﺘﻘﻮﻝ ﺃﻟﺴﻨﺔ اﻟﺬﺑﺎﺏ ﻗﺼﻴﺪﺓ); religion will be hijacked (ﺳﻴﺮﺗﻘﻲ ﺫﺋﺐ اﻟﺠﺒﺎﻝ اﻟﻤﻨﺒﺮا), and the clergy will side with the state (اﻟﻤﺆﺫﻥ ﻭاﻹﻣﺎﻡ ﻛﻼﻫﻤﺎ ﺳﻴﻘﻮﻝ ﺇﻧﺎ ﻻﺣﻘﺎﻥ ﺑﻘﻴﺼﺮا), etc. The second half of the poem is a call for optimism and is completely packaged in the Biblical/Quranic story of Yusuf (Joseph). So let's discuss all the references in the poem.

#**Historical and religious references**

* **Zarqa' al-Yamama** — The poem invokes several clairvoyant figures such as Yusuf, Yacoub (Jacob) and Zarqa', the titular character. From pre-Islamic Arab folklore, she was a blue-eyed (hence ﺯﺭﻗﺎء) Najdi woman from the Al-Yamama region of modern day Saudi Arabia (the region was named after her) who had keen intuition and eyesight to the point where she could see invading tribes marching in the far distance and warn her tribe about about them three days in advance of their arrival. One day enemies of her tribe, in order to avoid her gaze, cut up a forest and hid behind the trees they were carrying (eerily similar to MacDuff's plot in Shakespeare's *Macbeth*). Zarqa' noticed and warned her tribe about the moving forest (ﺇﻧﻲ ﺃﺭﻯ اﻟﺸﺠﺮ ﻗﺪ ﺃﻗﺒﻞ ﺇﻟﻴﻜﻢ), but they thought she had gone mad and ignored her. After which of course her entire tribe was slaughtered and her eyes were plucked out by the invaders. Then they crucified her. In the title of the poem, she is invoked to convey the meaning that there were things we (Arabs) weren't warned about — instead, the poet himself must now assume the role of the seer and try and decipher the gut feeling he has (ﺷﺠﺮ ﻣﻦ اﻟﺤﺪﺱ اﻟﻘﺪﻳﻢ).

* **The Qarmatians** (اﻟﻘﺮاﻣﻄﺔ) were an Ismaili Shia group that revolted against the Abbasid Caliphate and founded the Qarmatian state (899CE) in historical Bahrain (Eastern Arabia). In 906CE they ambushed a pilgrim caravan returning from Mecca and massacred 20,000 pilgrims, and in 930CE, with their leader Abu Taher, infamously sacked Mecca and Medina, attacking Islam's holiest sites, desecrating the Zamzam well with corpses of pilgrims and stealing the Black Stone from the Ka'aba. It was a low point for the Islamic world and a humiliation for the Abbasid Caliphate. So the Qarmatians were brutal, religious fanatics who founded their own state and desecrated Islam's name. Sound familiar? The poet likely invokes the Qarmatians to once again warn against those religious groups who use Islam only to further their own political agenda but the parallel — between the Qarmatians and ISIS — is uncanny. It's unlikely that he actually meant ISIS; by early 2012 they hadn't emerged as major players yet.

* **Shanfara** — Shanfara was a famous poet who swore vengeance on the Azd (a Yemeni tribe) for killing his father and enslaving him as young boy, even though they raised him as one of them. He vowed to kill a hundred of them and succeeded, but as he was kicking the 100th man's corpse a piece of his skull punctured Shanfara's foot and killed him (don't ask). It's likely that the poet alludes to Shanfara in verse 14 as a metaphor for states being afraid of the victims of their injustices, and their crackdown on rebels.

* **ﻋﻨﺪَ اﻟﺼّﺒﺎﺡِ ﺳﻴﺤﻤِﺪُ اﻟﻘَﻮﻡ اﻟﺴُّﺮَﻯ**, a famous proverb first said by Khalid Ibn al-Walid to motivate his troops as they were marching through the desert from al-Yamama (the very same region mentioned above) after the Ridda Wars to conquer the Persian province of Iraq under Abu Bakr's orders. The saying means that in the morning, you will be glad to have put the effort in and got whatever it is you have to do out of the way instead of succumbing to laziness and sleeping, for example. 

* **Khaybar** — The usage of Khaybar (اﻥ اﺭاﺩﻭا ﺧﻴﺒﺮا) here, an old Jewish town near Medina, could be interpreted as a metaphor for a strong, prosperous and vibrant community (since the people mentioned in this verse are Joseph's brothers i.e. the Israelites/Hebrews) or as a reference to the Battle of Khaybar: a watershed moment when the Muslim forces conquered the Jewish tribes of Khaybar, with obvious parallels to Arabs defeating Israel.

* **Yusuf** — There are a few biblical references scattered in the poem, such as Adam eating two apples instead of one; or a *"deluge passing through our homelands"*, a reference to Noah's flood, a great disaster but also a great *cleanser*; but the main message of hopefulness and optimism is conveyed through the story of Joseph. For those who aren't familiar with the narrative of Yusuf, please [read it here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_in_Islam). It's very important for understanding the poem and there's not enough space here to write it. Once you read it, these references become clear:

    * Joseph has a vision in his sleep, unlike our poet, who makes it clear that ﻣﺎ ﻧﻤﺖ ﻛﻲ ﺃﺻﻄﺎﺩ ﺭﺅﻳﺎ ﻓﻲ اﻟﻜﺮﻯ
    * Joseph tells Jacob his vision, just like our poet ﻧﺎﺩﻳﺖ: ﻳﺎ ﻳﻌﻘﻮﺏ! ﺗﻠﻚ ﻧﺒﻮءﺗﻲ. Notice here that Jacob is called upon since Jacob has lived in blindness/darkness and so he is the best figure to guide the poet.
    * Jacob consoles the poet by saying ﻻ ﺗﺒﺘﺌﺲ ﻓﺎﻟﺒﺌﺮ ﻳﻮﻡ ﻭاﺣﺪ, as in, the ordeal that Joseph has in the well is only a momentary thing, and tomorrow ﺗﺄﻣﺮﻙ اﻟﺮﻳﺎﺡ ﻋﻠﻰ اﻟﻘﺮﻯ, a reference to Joseph becoming the treasurer of Egypt.
    * ﺳﺒﻊ ﻋﺠﺎﻑ (seven famished years) and ﻓﻠﺘﺨﺰﻧﻮا is a reference to Joseph's interpretations of the Pharaoh's dream as a prediction of seven years of famine which they must prepare for by storing as much food as possible and being disciplined with consumption. The parallels with the Arab spring (bitter years are coming) are obvious.
    * The last two verses are a reference to Joseph sending his shirt with his brothers back to Jacob, and Jacob sensing it (اﺷﺘﻢ ﺭاﺋﺤﺔ اﻟﻘﻤﻴﺺ) as the convoy carrying it (ﻗﺎﻓﻠﺔ اﻟﺒﺸﻴﺮ) was approaching. ﻫﻄﻞ اﻟﻘﻤﻴﺺ ﻋﻠﻰ اﻟﻌﻴﻮﻥ ﻭﺑﺸﺮا is about how touching Joseph's shirt restored Jacob's vision. Here Jacob is sensing the shirt (a symbol of hope and restoration) for the poet (and for Arabs as a whole).

And so forth with other allusions to Joseph that I won't mention here, since unfortunately Reddit doesn't allow me enough characters per thread. Suffice to say that the usage of Joseph's narrative, about an Israelite boy sold into slavery who then becomes one of the most powerful men in Egypt, carries a message of hope.

#**Imagery and language**

There are a few delightful metaphors and linguistic easter eggs in the poem. The deliberate and repeated usage of the word 'season' (ﻓﻲ اﻟﻤﻮﺳﻢ اﻵﺗﻲ) mirrors the usage of seasons to denote the periods of the Arab revolts — 'Arab Spring', 'Arab Winter', etc. The image of اﻟﺨﺎﺭﺟﻴﻦ اﻵﻥ ﻣﻦ ﺻﻤﺖ اﻟﺜﺮﻯ, with 'ﺻﻤﺖ اﻟﺜﺮﻯ' here being a euphemism for death,  refers to the revolting Arab masses who have finally awakened from their passivity, and Jacob asks the poet to salute them and the hope they bring. There's a cool juxtaposition in verse 23 between the *bitterness* (ﻣُﺮّﺓ) of the coming years, and turning that pain into *sweetness* (ﺳُﻜﺮا). There's also a contrast between the "tree of intuition" in verse 4 and the "trees of confusion" in verse 12. Interestingly, while a raincloud (ﻏﻴﻤﺔ) in the Western world is often a bad omen, and a negative thing, in Arabic poetry its a positive symbol since it brings much-needed rain — in verse 17 the poet's prediction that the "saturated raincloud won't rain" on the Arab World is actually a bad thing; Arabs *want* it to rain. Also, to invoke flies (اﻟﺬﺑﺎﺏ) as in verse 9 is to invoke the lowest and the scummiest of creatures. Consider these famous verses:

<div class="ar rtl"></div>

ﺫا ﺳﻘﻂ اﻟﺬﺑﺎﺏُ ﻋﻠﻰ ﻃﻌﺎﻡ|*|ٍﺭﻓﻌﺖ ﻳﺪﻱ ﻭﻧﻔﺴﻲ {{'ﺗﺸﺘﻬﻴﻪ' | define:'desires it'}}

Finally, I couldn't discuss the imagery and metaphors line by line and instead had to focus on the essential references in the poem that would help decipher most of it. However, we can easily discuss these things in the comments and I'd love to hear what you thought of the poem and your interpretations of its verses.
